# Explore the Azure OpenAI Service

The goal of this 45-minute lab is to:
  * Understand the capabilities of Azure OpenAI Service
  * Learn how to use and customize natural language generative AI models like GPT-3.5 and ChatGPT
  * Learn the difference between Fine-Tuning, Prompt Engineering and Retrieval Augmented Generation.

## Pre-requisites
