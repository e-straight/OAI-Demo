## DALL-E (Preview)
In this section, we will take a brief look at the capabilities of DALL-E in Azure OpenAI.

1. Navigate to DALL-E (Preview)
2. Staying with our Margie's Travel example, enter the following prompt, click **Generate** and observe the output.

`Can you create a mock brochure for me that uses notable landmarks from NY, London and San Francisco?`

3. Not satisfied with that image? Try clicking the **Generate new image** button to get a new response.
4. While prompt engineering is critical with chat based models, it is even more important with image based models. That being said, let's try a new prompt:

`Can you create a mock brochure for me that includes the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower? Make sure the Statue of Liberty and Eiffel Tower are shown cartoon style.`

- The more specific you are with your prompts, the better results you will get.
